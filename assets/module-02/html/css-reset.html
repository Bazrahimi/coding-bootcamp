            <ol>
              <li>
                <u>Style Rule and Declarations:</u> 
                <ul>
                  <li>a style rule has a selector and one or more Declarations.</li>
                  <li>a selector target one or more elements.</li>
                  <li>Declarations define the specific styles to be applied to the selected elements. each Declarations consist of a CSS <i>Property</i> and CSS <i>Value.</i></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Order of Style Rules:</u>

                  <li>
                    if multiple rule target the same element, the last rule will take precedence.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Importance:</u>
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    when a stile rule is declared <i>!important</i> it will override any conflicting styles, regardless of specificity or order.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                <u>Origin of Styles:</u>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    style can come from different source: user agent stylesheet(default stylesheet from browser), author stylesheet (the developer), user stylesheet (applied on the web browser based on user preferences and setting), and inline styles.

                </ul>
              </li>

          <li>
            <b>Specificity:</b> the browser uses to decide which property value is to applied to the element if the same element is selected multiple time by different selectors. <br>
            The hierarchy of specificity, from highest to lowest.
          </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <u>Inline Style: </u> has the hightiest specificity, because they are applied directly to the element.
              </li>

              <li>
              <u> ID Selector:</u> it is more specific than class selector.
              </li>

              <li>
                <u>Class Selector:</u> class selector, <u>attribute selector</u>, <u>pseudo-class</u> has equal specificity. they target elements based on their class name. <br>

              <li>
                <u>Universal</u> and <u>Combinator Selector</u> has the lowest specificity. <br>
                Universal Selector target all elements by  "*". <br>

                <i>Child Combinator</i> is selected by ">". <br>
                <i>Adjacent Sibling Combinator</i> is selected by "+". these selector has the lowest specificity. <br>

          <b>Inheritance:</b> allow certain styles to be inherited by child elements from their parent elements. when a style element is applied to the parent, it will automatically applied to <u>child or nested element</u> too. this help reducing the amount CSS code required. <br>

          Some commonly elements which are used to have child or nested elements in them. <br>
