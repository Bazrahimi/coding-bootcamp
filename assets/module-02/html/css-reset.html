    <h1>CSS Reset</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of a CSS reset is to override or neutralize the default styles of CSS, which can vary between browsers. By resetting the default styles, developers can apply their own styles consistently. <br>
      By resetting the styles, it helps to avoid variations and inconsistencies.
      <br>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) â€” the term 'cascading' refers to the process of combining and applying multiple styles to an element. <br> <br>
      The cascading process is based on three main principles.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Cascade:</b> The cascade refers to the process of how styles are applied to elements based on various factors. 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <u>Style Rules and Declarations:</u> 
            <ul>
              <li>A style rule has a selector and one or more declarations.</li>
              <li>A selector targets one or more elements.</li>
              <li>Declarations define the specific styles to be applied to the selected elements. Each declaration consists of a CSS <i>Property</i> and CSS <i>Value</i>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Order of Style Rules:</u>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In a CSS file, style rules are written one after another.
              </li>
              <li>
                The cascade checks the order of style rules to resolve conflicts.
              </li>
              <li>
                If multiple rules target the same element, the last rule will take precedence.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Importance:</u>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <i>'!important'</i> declaration can be added to a style rule to give it the highest priority. <br>
                <img src="../images/important.png" alt="illustration of the '!important' declaration in CSS">
              </li>
              <li>
                When a style rule is declared as <i>!important</i>, it will override any conflicting styles, regardless of specificity or order.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Origin of Styles:</u>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Styles can come from different sources: user agent stylesheet (default stylesheet from the browser), author stylesheet (from the developer), user stylesheet (applied to the web browser based on user preferences and settings), and inline styles.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Specificity:</b> Specificity is the criteria the browser uses to decide which property value to apply to an element if the same element is selected multiple times by different selectors. <br>
        The hierarchy of specificity, from highest to lowest:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <u>Inline Style:</u> Inline styles have the highest specificity because they are applied directly to the element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>ID Selector:</u> ID selectors are more specific than class selectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Class Selector:</u> Class selectors, <u>attribute selectors</u>, and <u>pseudo-classes</u> have equal specificity. They target elements based on their class names. <br>
            <img style="width: 200px" src="../images/class-selector.png" alt="image of different class selectors in CSS">
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Element</u> and <u>Pseudo-Element Selectors:</u> Element and pseudo-element selectors have lower specificity compared to class selectors. They target elements by HTML element categories.
            <br>
            <img style="width: 200px" src="../images/element -selector.png" alt="illustration of element selector">
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Universal</u> and <u>Combinator Selectors:</u> Universal and combinator selectors have the lowest specificity. <br>
            The universal selector targets all elements using "*". <br>
            Combinator selectors select elements based on their relationship to other elements. <br>
            <i>Descendant Combinator</i> is represented by a space. <br>
            <i>Child Combinator</i> is represented by ">". <br>
            <i>Adjacent Sibling Combinator</i> is represented by "+". These selectors have the lowest specificity. <br>
            <img style="width: 300px" src="../images/unversal-combinator-selector.png" alt="illustration of universal and combinator selectors"> <br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Inheritance:</b> Inheritance allows certain styles to be inherited by child elements from their parent elements. When a style is applied to the parent, it will automatically be applied to child or nested elements as well. This helps reduce the amount of CSS code required. <br>
        Some common elements are used to have child or nested elements in them. <br>
        <img style="width: 650px;" src="../images/child elements.png" alt="image of some common elements that are used to have child or nested elements in them"> <br> <br>
        <i>Empty Elements</i> or <i>Void Elements</i> are not able to have child elements nested in them. <br>
        <img style="width: 650px" src="../images/void elements.png" alt="illustration showing void elements are not able to have child elements nested in them">
      </li>
    </ol>
