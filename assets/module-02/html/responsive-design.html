    <h1>Responsive Design</h1>

    <p>
      Responsive design in CSS refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web applications that can adapt and respond to different screen sizes, orientations, and devices. <br>
      It is aimed at providing optimal viewing across a wide range of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. 
    </p>

    <h4>Some key principles and techniques:</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Fluid Grids:</b> Use relative units (such as width: 20%) and CSS grid systems to create flexible and fluid layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Flexible Images and Media:</b> Scale and resize images and media elements (videos, embedded content) to fit in the available space while maintaining their aspect ratio.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Media Queries:</b> Apply CSS rules based on specified device characteristics.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Breakpoints:</b> Define specific screen widths at which the website needs to change its layout. This is often used in conjunction with media queries.

        <b>Responsive Typography:</b> Use CSS to ensure that text is readable on different devices.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Mobile-first Approach:</b> Design and develop websites by considering mobile devices as the primary target and then progressively enhance the design for larger screens.
