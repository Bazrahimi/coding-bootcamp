    <h1>Semantic HTML Elements</h1>

      <h4>
        "Semantic" comes from the Greek word "Semantikos" and translates to "significant" or "meaningful". <br>
        The advantages of semantic elements are that they carry meaning, convey the purpose and structure of HTML elements, which improves the SEO, accessibility, and maintainability of the webpage.
