        <li>
          Media queries work by specifying a condition or set of conditions in CSS, if those conditions are met, the associated syeles will be applied.

        <li>
          the condition involves the properties of device, such as screen width, height, aspect ratio (aspect ratio of a device refers to relation between width and height. for example a device with aspect raiton of 16:9; means the device width is 19units and height 9 units), device orientation (portrait and landscape orientation), resolution, or even the type of device (e.g., screen, print and speech)
        </li>
        <li>
          media queries consist of <b>media type</b> and <b>media features</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>media type:</b> target type of devices; <b>all:</b> (all devices and media type). <b>screen:</b>(screen with and devices with visual output.) <b>print:</b> (applies when printing documents). <b>speech:</b> (applies to screen reader.)
        </li>

          <p style="line-height: 5px;"> @media (condition){</p>
