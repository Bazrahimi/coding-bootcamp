<h1>Script tags in JavaScript</h1>
<h4>In JavaScript, script tags are used to include and execute JavaScript code within HTML documents.</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Inline Script:</b> You include JavaScript code directly within HTML documents. <br>
    HTML Document: It consists of HTML elements and HTML tags, which are used to structure and format the content. <br>
    Structure and format of HTML consists of DOCTYPE, HTML element, Head section, Body section, HTML elements and tags, and HTML attributes. <br>
    HTML element: It is the element plus the opening and closing tags of the element. <br>
    HTML Tags: They are the opening and closing tags, excluding the element itself.

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>External script:</b> You can reference an external JavaScript file using the 'src' attribute of the script tag.

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Deferred Script:</b> By adding the <i>defer</i> attribute to the script tag, you can indicate that the script should be executed after the HTML document has been parsed. <br>
    <img style="width:300px" src="../images/defered script exampl.png" alt="defer script"> <br>
    In the above example, an HTML document with a deferred script is shown. <br>
    The <i>defer</i> attribute indicates that the script should be executed after the HTML document is parsed. This allows the browser to continue parsing the HTML without blocking the script execution. Additionally, the order of scripts is preserved. <br>
    You can place your JavaScript code within the <i>script.js</i> file, and it will be executed after the HTML document is parsed. The <i>src</i> attribute matches the file path of script.js.

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Async script:</b> Allows the script to be fetched and executed asynchronously without blocking the HTML parsing. <br>
